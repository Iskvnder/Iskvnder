Hi all, my name is Iskander (@Iskvnder)

I love video games and want to do ðŸ–¤Game DevelopmentðŸ–¤

I like all aspects of the game industry, I tried myself in modeling, animation, wrote a couple of concepts for games,
but most of all I like video game programming. 

I'm deeply convinced that it's the programming part of the game, its mechanics,
their interconnection if developed correctly, that can provide players with unforgettable game experience,
so I'm aiming at this part of this wonderful industry.

ðŸ“š My knowledge and skills:
- Basic C++, Java, and Python
- knowledge of OOP
- Basic Rhino 3D, Maya 3D
- Little university experience with Deep Learning in Python
- Little experience in VRay
- Unity and Unreal Engine basics
